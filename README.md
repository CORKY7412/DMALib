# DMALib

This is just a small library which contains the basic support for your DMA including
- memory reading
- memory writing
- getting PID and Base Address
- pattern scanning
- logging
- good documentation and clean code

Feel free to modify the code or make it better. Replace the example dlls with your own dlls.
The program expects you to have the dlls at the root directory when shipping the program.
